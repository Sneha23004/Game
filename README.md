This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++. It allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid. 
The game ends when one player wins by having three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or when the board is filled and the 
game is declared a draw.
